                        <h3>The Making of a God</h3>
                        <p class="drop-cap">In the quiet halls of ancient libraries, where dust motes dance in shafts of golden light and the scent of parchment mingles with possibility, there once lived a peculiar young scholar named Swennlau Hogivoathok. Small of stature but vast of curiosity, with cowlicked brown hair that defied all attempts at order and eyes just a bit too large for his sunburnt face, Swenn was the sort of person who would spend three days devising an elaborate magical solution to open a door when the key hung right beside it.</p>
                        
                        <p>Born to a family of respected evokers, Swenn disappointed his father greatly when he turned from the flashy destructive arts to the subtle mysteries of divination. "Where's the spectacle in seeing the future?" his father would grumble. "Where's the power in reading minds?" But Swenn found in divination something his family's explosive magic could never offer: understanding. Every spell he cast revealed new layers of complexity in the world, new mysteries to unravel, new patterns to comprehend.</p>
                        
                        <p>It was this insatiable hunger for understanding that led him to his greatest discovery—and ultimately, his ascension. In pursuing a mystery so complex that it had confounded scholars for millennia, Swenn developed an entirely new school of magic: Chronomancy, the manipulation of time itself. Through years of painstaking research, careful experimentation, and an almost supernatural ability to overcomplicate simple solutions until they became profound revelations, he became the first mortal to truly understand time's nature.</p>

                        <p>But knowledge, Swenn learned, comes with responsibility. The more he understood about the universe's intricate balance, the more he felt compelled to protect it. His ascension to godhood wasn't a dramatic moment of apotheosis—it was a gradual recognition, by mortals and immortals alike, that Swenn had become something more than human. He had become a living embodiment of the principle that all things seek balance, that all knowledge has its place, and that even the most complex problems can be solved with sufficient patience and wisdom.</p>

                        <p>As a deity, Swennlau appears much as he did in life, though his oversized eyes now hold depths that reflect the turning of ages, and his unruly hair seems to shimmer with temporal possibilities. He still favors floppy hats (much to the bemusement of other deities) and can often be found in divine libraries, reading books that exist in seventeen different timelines simultaneously.</p>

                            <p>This massive tome appears to be three books in one, its pages shifting between past, present, and future states. The left pages show what was, the right pages reveal what might be, and the center pages display what is. The book contains every piece of knowledge that has ever existed or ever will exist, though finding the right information often requires solving complex riddles that Swennlau, in his characteristic way, has embedded throughout.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Temporal Wisdom:</strong> The wielder can cast <em>legend lore</em>, <em>divination</em>, and <em>augury</em> at will without expending spell slots.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Balanced Perspective:</strong> Once per day, when making any d20 roll, you can choose to roll twice and take whichever result brings the total closer to 10.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Chronological Insight:</strong> The wielder gains the ability to cast <em>time stop</em> once per week, but must spend the stopped time reading or studying.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Universal Library:</strong> The book can answer any question that could theoretically be answered by research, though Swennlau's puzzles mean finding simple answers often requires solving complex riddles first.</li>

                            <p>This staff appears to be carved from crystallized time itself, its surface shifting through different ages and eras. At its head sits a perfect hourglass that contains sand from the very beginning and end of time. The staff grows longer or shorter depending on how much time the wielder has left to live, though Swennlau characteristically made this measurement so complex that no one has yet figured out the exact formula.</p>

                                    <li><strong>Measured Response:</strong> When initiative is rolled, the wielder can choose to act on any initiative count they wish, but must explain their reasoning in exactly 147 words.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Hourglass Divination:</strong> The sand in the hourglass can be used to cast any divination spell, though the prophecies always come in the form of extremely detailed but ultimately confusing temporal maps.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Balance Restoration:</strong> Once per day, can reverse any single action taken in the last round, but only if it would restore cosmic balance.</li>

                            <p>This mysterious skull belonged to the greatest scholar to ever live before Swennlau—though the skull itself insists it's still the greater intellect and argues constantly with anyone who consults it.

                                    <li><strong>Scholarly Debate:</strong> Grants advantage on all Intelligence-based skill checks, but the skull will argue with every conclusion reached.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Overcomplicated Solutions:</strong> Once per day, can solve any puzzle or problem, but the solution will be unnecessarily elaborate and require at least three additional steps.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Academic Rivalry:</strong> The skull becomes jealous of any other source of information and will attempt to prove its superiority through increasingly pedantic corrections.</li>

                        <h3>Worship and Followers</h3>
                        <p>What makes Swennlau unique among deities is his complete lack of understanding regarding the concept of worship. He genuinely doesn't comprehend why mortals would want to venerate him, seeing himself simply as someone who happens to know a lot of things and is happy to share. This peculiar divine perspective means that <strong>Swennlau responds to anyone who seeks knowledge, balance, or understanding</strong>—regardless of whether they believe in him, worship him, or even know he exists.</p>
                        
                        <p>Temples to Swennlau are called <strong>Halls of Measured Wisdom</strong> and are invariably built within or adjacent to great libraries. These sacred spaces are characterized by their perfect organization (despite Swennlau's personal tendency toward complexity), comfortable reading chairs, excellent lighting, and an atmosphere of peaceful contemplation. The largest such hall exists within the Great Library of Greyhaven, where scholars from across The Greenwold come to research the most challenging mysteries.</p>

                        <p>Smaller shrines, known as <strong>Balance Alcoves</strong>, can be found in libraries, courts of law, diplomatic halls, and anywhere difficult decisions must be made. These alcoves always contain a set of perfectly balanced scales, a collection of increasingly complex puzzle boxes, and usually at least one really excellent floppy hat hanging on a peg.</p>
