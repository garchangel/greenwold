                        <h3>From the Depths to the Heights</h3>
                        <p class="drop-cap">In the deepest, darkest mines beneath The Greenwold's mountain ranges, where honest dwarves sweat for honest coin, there once prowled a thief whose very name was whispered as a curse. Enza began life as the basest of criminals—a mountain dwarf who preyed upon her own people, stealing the fruits of their backbreaking labor, caring nothing for the families left hungry by her greed. She was everything the dwarven clans despised: dishonorable, selfish, willing to break any trust for personal gain.</p>
                        
                        <p>But even the hardest stone can be reforged in the right flame, and Enza's transformation began the day she attempted to rob the wrong dwarf. Thormund Ironforge was no ordinary mountain dwarf—he was a Battle Master of legendary skill, a fighter who had led countless successful campaigns and earned the respect of every warrior who served under him. When Enza's blade found his throat in a darkened alley, she expected fear, compliance, perhaps a few coins to make the crime worthwhile.</p>
                        
                        <p>Instead, she found herself flat on the stone floor within seconds, her own weapon turned against her, staring up at eyes that held no anger—only pity and something that looked disturbingly like recognition. "I know that desperation, lass," Thormund said, extending a scarred hand to help her up. "I know that rage that gnaws at your belly and makes you think the world owes you something. But I also see something else in you—steel that hasn't been properly forged, strength that hasn't found its purpose."</p>
                        
                        <p>What followed was the most brutal education of Enza's life. Thormund didn't just teach her to fight—he taught her to lead, to plan, to see three moves ahead in combat and politics alike. More importantly, he taught her that true strength came not from taking what others had earned, but from protecting what others had built. Under his tutelage, Enza learned that the same skills that had made her a successful thief—quick thinking, tactical awareness, absolute fearlessness in the face of danger—could be turned toward noble purposes.</p>

                    <div class="transformation-section">
                        <h3>The Choice That Defines All</h3>
                        <p>As Enza's training neared its end, Thormund shared with her the fundamental truth that governs all who live by the sword: "Listen well, lass, for this lesson will shape the rest of your days. Every fighter, no matter how skilled, no matter how noble their beginnings, faces the same three paths in the end. You can become a leader—one who uses strength to protect others and guide them to victory. You can become a tyrant—one who uses strength to dominate and control, bending others to your will. Or you can die, struck down before you must make that choice."</p>
                        
                        <p>"The world has enough tyrants," he continued, his weathered face grave with the weight of experience. "It has more than enough graves filled with good fighters who fell before they could realize their potential. What it needs—what it has always needed—are leaders. Those who understand that true power comes not from commanding others, but from inspiring them to be more than they thought possible."</p>
                        
                        <p>When the time came to make that choice, Enza chose to live and to lead. She took the oaths of protection, swearing to defend not just the innocent, but the idea that anyone could be redeemed, that even the most broken person could be reforged into something greater. Her transformation from criminal to protector became the foundation of her divine nature—the living proof that redemption is always possible for those willing to do the work.</p>
