                        <h3>The Hollow Birth</h3>
                        <p class="drop-cap">In the cosmic wound left by the chronomancy spell that shattered time itself, something was born that should never have existed—not a being, but an absence. The Silence emerged as Dongus Peardrum's temporal echo, but where the original contained friendship, loyalty, moral restraint, and the capacity for growth, this shadow held only void. Every quality that had redeemed Dongus, every bond that had saved him from his dark destiny, every moment of hesitation that had stayed his hand—all of it was simply missing, leaving behind a perfectly efficient instrument of death.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Silence possesses all of Dongus's skills, all of his tactical brilliance, all of his supernatural abilities, but none of his humanity. They are what the feared assassin would have become if no friends had ever reached out, if no moment of doubt had ever stayed their hand, if no capacity for love had ever complicated their calculations. They are not driven by rage, greed, or ambition—such emotions require a self to feel them. Instead, they operate with the terrifying purity of a natural disaster, eliminating targets with the same dispassion that winter kills flowers.</p>
                        
                        <p>Most horrifying of all, The Silence makes no sound. No footsteps, no breathing, no whisper of blade through air. They move through the world as a void in the fabric of reality itself, and those who encounter them often don't realize they're in danger until the silence around them becomes absolute—and eternal.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="void-nature-section">
                        <h3>The Nature of Nothing</h3>
                        <p>Understanding The Silence requires understanding what they are not. They are not cruel—cruelty requires deriving pleasure from suffering, and The Silence feels nothing. They are not angry—anger is passion, and The Silence is the absence of all passion. They are not even truly evil in the way mortals understand the concept, because evil suggests motivation, and The Silence acts only from perfect, emotionless efficiency.</p>
                        
                        <p>This absence of humanity makes them more terrifying than any raging demon or scheming devil. Their draconic aspect manifests not as storms of emotion like Dongus, but as zones of absolute silence where even the beating of hearts becomes muted. Where Dongus's planning served to protect those he cared about, The Silence's identical tactical genius serves only to identify the most efficient method of elimination.</p>
                        
                        <p>They maintain connections to the same proto-gods that once whispered to Dongus, but where those entities offered Dongus power in exchange for embracing darkness, they simply use The Silence as an instrument. The Bray Mother finds them the perfect tool—utterly reliable, completely without mercy, and incapable of the moral growth that ruined their plans for Dongus.</p>

                            <p>Forged from the absence where The Silence's compassion should have been, this weapon appears as a jagged, broken dagger that seems to absorb light and sound around it.

                        <p>The Silence does not preach or teach in any conventional sense—they have no need to convert followers, no desire to spread their influence, no grand plans for the world. However, their existence serves as a living doctrine for those who find themselves drawn to the void within themselves, those who have been hurt so deeply that they choose numbness over feeling, silence over connection.</p>

                        <p>These followers are often people who were once capable of love and loyalty but were so deeply betrayed or wounded that they chose to cut away their capacity for emotion entirely. Former lovers who were abandoned, soldiers who were betrayed by their commanders, children who were forgotten by their parents—all drawn to the promise that feeling nothing is better than feeling pain.</p>
