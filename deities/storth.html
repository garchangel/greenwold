                        <h3>The Making of a God</h3>
                        <p class="drop-cap">In the ancient days of The Greenwold, when the great city of Greyhaven was but a gleaming vision and the Taglebrier Forest held mysteries untold, there lived a human bard whose name would echo through eternity. Storth Cleartree was no ordinary minstrel—he was a keeper of stories, a guardian of hope, and unknowingly, the seed from which both salvation and damnation would grow.</p>
                        
                        <p>The tale of Storth's ascension is itself a story worth telling, though the details have become legend wrapped in mystery. In life, Storth was consumed by a warforged construct in circumstances lost to time—some say it was a heroic sacrifice, others claim it was an accident of magical experimentation. What is known is that through will, magic, or divine intervention, Storth freed himself from the construct's form, though the experience forever changed him.</p>
                        
                        <p>This transformation became the foundation of his divine nature. As a deity, Storth appears sometimes as the human he once was—warm, wise, with eyes that hold the weight of every story ever told. Other times, he manifests in warforged form, a being of metal and magic that speaks to the enduring nature of tales carved in steel and etched in crystal.</p>

                            <p>Storth's most sacred artifact is an instrument of unparalleled power. Its golden frame gleams with inner light, and its strings appear to be woven from captured starlight itself. It is said that this lyre can play any song that has ever been composed, will ever be composed, or exists in the spaces between reality and dream.</p>

                        <p>Temples dedicated to Storth are called <strong>Cleartree Sanctuaries</strong>, often built in groves where ancient trees have been hollowed out to create reading rooms and performance spaces. These sanctuaries serve as libraries, concert halls, and places of refuge for those whose stories have taken dark turns.</p>
                        
                        <p>The largest of these sanctuaries stands in Greyhaven itself, where the great <strong>Library of Endless Stories</strong> houses thousands of volumes and provides shelter for wandering bards and scholars. Smaller sanctuaries can be found throughout The Greenwold, often marked by the presence of <strong>Resonance Stones</strong>—small crystals that glow faintly and can preserve important memories or stories for future generations.</p>
