                        <h3>The Mirror's Creation</h3>
                        <p class="drop-cap">In the darkest chapters of The Greenwold's history, there exists a tale of such tragedy that many scholars refuse to record it, and those who do speak of it only in whispers. It is the story of The Empyrean—a being who began as a reflection of hope and became the embodiment of sacrificial despair, a god whose very existence serves as a warning about the prices we pay for the choices we make in desperate times.</p>
                        
                        <p>The Empyrean was never meant to exist. Born from a catastrophic chronomancy spell that sought to peer through time's veil, The Empyrean emerged as a dark reflection of Storth Cleartree—not his opposite, but his shadow, possessing all of Storth's potential twisted into forms that serve darker purposes. Where Storth preserved stories, The Empyrean collected secrets. Where Storth inspired hope, The Empyrean whispered of necessary sacrifices.</p>
                        
                        <p>The spell that created this cosmic error occurred during a period of great crisis in The Greenwold, when heroes were desperately seeking knowledge that might save their world from an unnamed threat. In their pursuit of temporal wisdom, they unknowingly created a temporal echo—a being with all of Storth's memories and capabilities, but existing in a reality where every good choice had led to a terrible consequence.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="corruption-section">
                        <h3>The Fall into Darkness</h3>
                        <p>What makes The Empyrean's story particularly tragic is that their fall was motivated by the purest of intentions. Faced with the destruction of everything they held dear, this mirror-Storth made the choice that their original would never make—they sacrificed everything and everyone they cared about in a desperate gambit to save the world.</p>
                        
                        <p>But desperate times make fools of the wise and monsters of the righteous. In their desperation, The Empyrean reached for power they did not understand, seeking artifacts that promised the strength needed to protect those they loved. The Eye and Hand of Vecna called to them in their darkest hour, whispering promises of the power needed to set things right.</p>
                        
                        <p>The corruption was subtle at first. The Eye showed them hidden truths that others were too weak to face. The Hand gave them the power to make the hard choices that others wouldn't make. But with each use, each "necessary" sacrifice, The Empyrean lost more of themselves to Vecna's influence. By the time they realized what was happening, it was too late—they had become the very threat they had sought to prevent.</p>

                        <p>Unlike most evil deities who gather followers through promises of power or dominion, The Empyrean attracts those who have already lost everything.

                        <p><strong>Tombs of the Forgotten</strong> serve as The Empyrean's temples—hidden burial sites where their followers inter those they have sacrificed in the name of a greater good.
